The project you've shared builds a Personalized AI-based Treatment Recommender using multiple machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and optimizing them with hyperparameter tuning. Here's a breakdown and summary of your work:

1. Data Preprocessing:
The dataset contains various symptoms (e.g., itching, skin rash) as features and medical diagnoses (prognosis) as the target labels.
Using pandas, you load the dataset and check its shape, which reveals that it has 4920 rows and 133 columns.
The dataset is split into features (X) and labels (y). Labels are encoded using LabelEncoder to transform string labels into numerical values.
Finally, the dataset is split into training and test sets (70% train, 30% test).
2. Model Training:
Several machine learning models are trained to predict the medical diagnosis (prognosis):
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Multinomial Naive Bayes
All models achieve perfect accuracy (100%) on the test data, which might suggest potential overfitting or a dataset with a clear and strong relationship between features and labels.
3. Evaluation (Accuracy and Confusion Matrix):
You evaluated the performance of each model using the accuracy score and confusion matrix.
The results showed that all models perfectly classify all instances.
The confusion matrices show no misclassification (all values outside the diagonal are zeros), which correlates with the 100% accuracy.
4. Data Visualization:
A Confusion Matrix Heatmap is generated for each model using seaborn for a clearer representation of the classification results.
An Accuracy Comparison Bar Plot is plotted to visually compare the performance of each model, all showing an accuracy of 1.0.
5. Model Performance Improvement (Hyperparameter Tuning):
Hyperparameter tuning is applied to the SVC model using GridSearchCV to explore different values for C and kernel.
Cross-validation is done with 5 folds for each combination of parameters.
The best parameters are found based on the grid search, which will further refine the modelâ€™s performance.
